Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into individual words or tokens. In Python, you can use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to perform tokenization. If you don't have NLTK installed, you can install it using pip install nltk.

Here's a basic code snippet that demonstrates tokenization using NLTK:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Download necessary resources for tokenization

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Input text
text = "I am Bangash Owais from Pakistan, currently working as a Software Engineer at SIAT CAS Shenzhen China!"

# Tokenize the text
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Print the tokens
for token in tokens:
    print(token)
